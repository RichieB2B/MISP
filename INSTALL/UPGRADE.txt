# 1. Upgrade procedure from v2.3 to v2.4
# it is assumed that the upgrade happens from an up-to-date 2.3 instance
# It is a good idea to back up your MISP installation and data before upgrading to a new release.

# - git pull the latest version of MISP from https://github.com/MISP/MISP.git
git pull
git checkout 2.4
git submodule init
git submodule update

# delete everything from MISP's cache directory to get rid of the cached models
find /var/www/MISP/app/tmp/cache/ -type f -not -name 'empty' -delete

# clear the old submodule cached entry for CakeResque
cd /var/www/MISP
git rm --cached app/Plugin/CakeResque/

# make sure that your database is backed up
mysqldump -u [misp_mysql_user] -p [misp_database] > /home/[my_user]/misp_db_pre_migration.sql
# upgrade your database with the new tables / fields introduces in 2.4
cd /var/www/MISP/INSTALL
mysql -u [misp_mysql_user] -p [misp_database] < upgrade_2.4.sql

# After this run the upgrade script from within the application
# simply navigate to Administration -> Administrative Tools -> "Upgrade to 2.4"
# Once that has completed successfully run the 2.3->2.4 cleanup script
# simply navigate to Administration -> Administrative Tools -> "2.3->2.4 cleanup script"

# If everything went fine, switch the system to live:
# Administration -> Server Settings -> MISP Settings -> MISP.live -> True
# NOTE: if nothing happens, please check the permissions of the config files in /var/www/MISP/app/Config/
#       and make sure the webserver has the write permissions on them:
#         chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/MISP/app/Config/

# Let us know if you run into any issues during or after the upgrade
